# hello_world
I am a guy just learning how to use Github. Don't mind this repository, it is a training exercise.

This is a comfortable keyboard.

# So here I am...

Trying to learn Github on the Windows.

This is surprisingly

*difficult*

But I guess if it was easy then everyone would be an electrical engineer.
